<h1>Rice Images Classification Using CNN</h1>
<h3>Problem Statement for Image Classification:</h3>
<p>Rice is one of the most widely produced grain products globally, with numerous genetic varieties distinguished by characteristics such as texture, shape, and color. Identifying and classifying these varieties is essential for evaluating seed quality, optimizing agricultural practices, and meeting market demands. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based image classification model capable of accurately distinguishing between five varieties of rice—Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag—commonly cultivated in Turkey.</p>
<p>The dataset contains 75,000 high-resolution images of rice grains, with 15,000 samples per variety. Leveraging these images, the model will learn to recognize the unique visual features that differentiate the varieties. The ultimate goal is to provide a robust solution for automated rice variety classification, which can assist in agricultural research, quality control, and commercial applications.</p>
